      <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
      <ul>
      <li><p><strong>What you can do with the jQuery? </strong>It is possible to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications; create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library; to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets. </li>
      <li><p><strong>How it can help you as web developer? </strong>jQuery simplifies the syntax for finding, selecting, and manipulating DOM elements.</li>
      <li><p><strong>If you think our earlier participant list app, in what kind of issues you could use jQuery? </strong>I could have used jQuery as a function to add person to the list.</li>
      <li><p><strong>What are CDNs? What kind of benefits you get if you use them? </strong>CDN is a Content Delivery Network provided by Google and Microsoft. Many users already have downloaded jQuery from Google or Microsoft when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assignment 2</h2>
      <p>You can find the modified participant list application from <a href="/addPerson_jquery">here</a>.</p>
